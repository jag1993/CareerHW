<h2> Desired Job Titles: </h2>

<h3>Web Developer (for a non-technical company)</h3> 
<h4> Example: <a href="http://www.indeed.com/cmp/Fuller-Theological-Seminary/jobs/Web-Developer-bc9517f774293737?q=junior+web+developer
"> Fuller Theological Seminary - Pasadena, CA </a></h4>

<p>I am in no way religious but job titles similar to these sound appealing to me. This is because it requires explaining technical issues to people with a non-technical background and I feel like I could be the person to do that. 
One of the requirements that was mentioned in the example was having patience and a sense of humor. That being said, I would assume that the working environment is light hearted which is what I would prefer as opposed to a job where you’re constantly on your feet. </p>



<h3>Junior Front End Developer</h3> 
<h4> Example: <a href="http://www.vaco.com/job-search.html?record_id=6247&referrer=%2Fjob-search.html%3Fpage%3D13%26search%3D%26address%3D%26miles%3D25%26type%3D%26order%3Dad_startdate%2520DESC%26industry%3D%26location%3D%26lat%3D%26lng%3D%26submit%3DFIND%2520JOBS"> VACO - Downtown Los Angeles </a></h4>

<p>I feel like I would enjoy doing front end web development work because I did enjoy the front end projects so far. I feel like I may have working knowledge of CSS and HTML but throughout the course I aim to improve on JavaScript. I mentioned MySQL because I like working with databases especially through web applications. I feel that database knowledge would still be needed eventually for front end devs as well.   </p>
