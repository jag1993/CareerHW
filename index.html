<p>I am in no way religious but job titles similar to these sound appealing to me. This is because it requires explaining technical issues to people with a non-technical background and I feel like I could be the person to do that. 
One of the requirements that they mentioned was having patience and a sense of humor. That being said, I would assume that the working environment is light hearted which is what I would prefer as opposed to a job where you’re constantly on your feet. </p>
